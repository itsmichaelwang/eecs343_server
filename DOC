The thread pool has a struct with lock, notify, threads, the queue which is a circular buffer with a head and a tail. 
Thread pool also contains the number of threads and the size limit.
Pool create function is pretty straight forward because it intializes the mutex and the condition variables using pthread_mutex_init() and pthread_cond_init()
Also, the pool create function also creates the threads accordingly by initializing the head, tail, thread count, and also queue size
pool_add_task first checks if the queue is full and if it is full, it will return a failure. Using the head and tail variables of the queue, we can detect if the queue is full since it is circular
pool_destroy signals all the threads to quit and then free the queue and the thread pool.
